<div>
    This determines the address type used to SSH to instances.
    Can be one of public_ipv4, public_ipv6 or interface_ip. Interface ip may
    could be either address family and depends on nodepool and
    upstream cloud configuration. Note that instances must be configured
    to have the appropriate address type and there must be connectivity
    from the jenkins master to the instance via that address type.
